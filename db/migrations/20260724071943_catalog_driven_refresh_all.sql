-- #262: marts.refresh_all() derives its refresh list from pg_matviews at runtime
-- instead of a hand-edited TEXT[] array (re-emitted 6x just to grow it; a mart
-- forgotten in the array silently never refreshed). A new mart now refreshes the
-- hour after its migration lands, with no function edit. Behavioral change,
-- accepted in #262: the array doubled as an inclusion list; the catalog loop
-- refreshes every matview in marts. Future exclusions belong in data (registry
-- row or guard), never back in a hand-edited array.
